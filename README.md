# Overview

Albatros is an open source UCI-compatible chess engine. It is not a complete chess programm and would require a UCI-compatible graphical user interface (GUI) (ex : Scid, Arena or Shredder) to be used comfortably.

The Albatros chess engine currently features 3 different evaluation functions for chess. The classical, which work with simple piece square tables (PSQT). And the two NNUE evaluation funtions, which are using the HalfKav2 and HalfKp architectures.Thes classical evaluation function is currently the only evaluation function that is implented efficiently.
